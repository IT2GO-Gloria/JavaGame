# Lion's Lair - A Dungeon Adventure Game

##### Technologies Used: Java

##### The user is given the following choices throughout the game:
* go further into the dungeon, 
* fight the random enemy, 
* drink a health potion or 
* quit the dungeon adventure

##### The next phase of this game it to:
* use an interface to create the visual aspect of the game,
* allow a user to pick up objects to view it,
* allow a user to use the object or open the object,
* allow the user to put the object in their bag for later use,
* when you ran away from an enemy, they still chase you along with the next random enemy,
* allow a user to go from room to room and view the rooms like you are watching a movie,
* Put in a backstory and a storyline with video and audio,
* allow a user to collect coins and keep track of amount,
* allow a user to trade or buy items from static players in the game,
* anything else I can think of to improve the game.
